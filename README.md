# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms in **C++**. Below is a brief overview of each algorithm, its time complexity, and typical usage scenarios.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
   - **Usage:** Simple but inefficient, used for small datasets or educational purposes.

2. **Selection Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
   - **Usage:** Better than bubble sort for small datasets, useful for learning purposes.

3. **Insertion Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
   - **Usage:** Efficient for small datasets, especially when the array is already partially sorted.

4. **Quick Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) on average
   - **Usage:** Efficient for large datasets; performance may degrade with bad pivot choices.

5. **Merge Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
   - **Usage:** Stable and consistent, ideal for large datasets where stability is required.
