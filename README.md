# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms in **C++**. Below is a brief overview of each algorithm, its time complexity, and typical usage scenarios.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
   - **Usage:** Simple but inefficient, used for small datasets or educational purposes.

2. **Selection Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
   - **Usage:** Better than bubble sort for small datasets, useful for learning purposes.

3. **Quick Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) on average
   - **Usage:** Efficient for large datasets; performance may degrade with bad pivot choices.

4. **Merge Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
   - **Usage:** Stable and consistent, ideal for large datasets where stability is required.

5. **Insertion Sort**
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n²)
   - **Usage:** Efficient for small datasets and nearly sorted data.

## Problem-Solving

1. **Two Sum Problem**
   - **Description:** Find two numbers that add up to a target value.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Usage:** Common problem in coding interviews.

2. **Counter Problem**
   - **Description:** Count occurrences of elements in an array.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Usage:** Useful for frequency counting.

3. **Remove Duplicates**
   - **Description:** Remove duplicates from a sorted array.
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
   - **Usage:** Simplifies an array by removing duplicate values.
